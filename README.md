## 🤖 AI Integration Details

### Hugging Face Emotion Detection
The app uses **Hugging Face's free Inference API** for intelligent mood analysis:

**Model**: `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`  
**Input**: User's journal entry text  
**Processing**: Deep learning-based emotion classification  
**Output**: Structured emotion data with confidence scores

**Detected Emotions**:
- Joy → Happy
- Sadness → Sad
- Anger → Angry
- Fear → Anxious
- Surprise → Excited
- Neutral → Neutral

**Sample Response:**
```javascript
{
  mood: "happy",
  intensity: 8,
  emotions: ["joy", "surprise", "neutral"],
  summary: "A moment of celebration and excitement",
  suggestion: "Keep celebrating these positive moments!",
  aiPowered: true
}
```

### Fallback System
If AI analysis fails (no internet, API limit, model loading), the app automatically uses **rule-based analysis**:
- Keyword detection for mood identification
- Punctuation and capitalization for intensity calculation
- Context-aware emotion extraction
- Ensures app works 100% of the time
